        Shree Vindhyavasini Secondary school is a community school, situated in
        historical place Batulechaur, northernpart of a tourism city Pokhara,
        Nepal.In 1971 B.S., a language school named as ‘Bhasha Pathashala’was
        established to teach only rituals, astrology and mathematics in
        Batulechaur, Pokhara .On the basis of this foundation, the School first
        named as Vindhyavasini Aadhar School was established in 12th Bhadra,
        2004 in the surroundings of the winter palace of the historical king
        Kulmandan Shah of kaski State with the objective of providing education
        based on Gandhian education. The school which was earlier said to be
        established in the vicinity of Vindhya Vasini temple but later on it was
        established in Batulechaur and named as Vindhyavasini Adhar School. The
        first founder headmaster was Pandit Muktinath Sharma Timsina .The school
        was started with 23 students in class one. Gradually,it was upgraded to
        lower secondary level and secondary level in 2014 B.S. and 2018 B.S.
        respectively. In the first SLC batch of this school in 2021 B.S., Seven
        students appeared the examination and all of them passed. The Golden
        Jubilee was organized on the occasion of 50th glorious year of
        establishment on Kartik 8th and 9th of 2056 B.S. Shrimad Bhagavata
        Mahapuran and National Mahayagya were organized from 23rd to 30th
        Kartik,2057 B.S. to establish 10 + 2 level. At first Management stream
        in grade 11 was started from 17th Srawan, 2058 B.S. and then Education

        running in the school building since 2066 B.S. At present, classes from
        baby to twelve are running in English medium which was started from 2066

        the basis of SEE examination, this school has stood in second position
        in Kaski district and third position in Gandaki Province. On the
        occasion of 40th National Education Day and World Literacy Day, the
        school was awarded by Ministry of Social Development, Gandaki Province.
        It is one of the leading schools in Gandaki province. According to
        performance audit (Capsule Report) of Nepal Government it stood first
        rank by scoring 94.59% among 5,133 community schools of Nepal. For Grade
        XI intake, students who have passed SEE or equivalent examination are
        eligible to apply for admission for Science and Management respectively
        at this school. We are thinking to run technical stream in coming years.
        On the basis of motto of school “Discipline and Dedication for Quality
        Education”, We hope it will be a leading government school and aims
        making disciplined and dedicated human resources for the sake of nation.
